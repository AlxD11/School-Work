The palindrome tester determines wether or not an entered C-string is a palindrome. It is not case sensitive, and cannot handle more than 80 characters at once. Error handling for when more than 80 characters were entered was not required on either version, so the C version doesn't even bother. The professor awarded bonus points if we didn't use string functions that started with str.
